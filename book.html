The way you make me smile have already made a place in my heart. I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can‚Äôt imagine not having you in my life.

Just like an ideal, beautiful woman, you carry yourself with wisdom, knowing exactly how to act in every moment. That little possessiveness of yours isn‚Äôt just a trait; it‚Äôs a silent promise that I am yours, and you are mine. You are addictive‚Äîsomeone I can never get enough of‚Äîyet you hide your tenderness beneath a playful veil of anger. But I see through it‚ÄîI see the way you care, the unspoken love in your every gesture. Every call with you feels like a chapter in a story I never want to end, a bond painted in the color of a rose‚Äîdelicate yet enduring, beautiful yet fierce.
